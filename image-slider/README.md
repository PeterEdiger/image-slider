# Image Slider Component



**This is a image-slider.component for reusage**

**Its possible to switch gallerys/project and skip forward and back**

Disclaimer: I used my own **mixed ins in the SCSS**
That is something you would need to refactor. 

Its easy to see from the mixed in name what was used there. 
**Just a dflex container and height width.**

You would also need to define your own color because a variable is used.


Have fun using this component.
